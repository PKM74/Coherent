# Coherent
Coherent is a clone of the Unix operating system for IBM PC compatibles and other microcomputers, developed and sold by the now-defunct Mark Williams Company (MWC). Historically, the operating system was a proprietary product, but it became open source in 2015, released under a 3-clause BSD License.

# Why am i forking this?
Well, i have a large intrest in OS development, and would love to work on something that is existing

## Goals:
